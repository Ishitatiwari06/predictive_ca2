# 🚗 Toyota Vehicle Data Analysis using Machine Learning
This project performs a comprehensive machine learning analysis on a Toyota vehicle dataset by applying both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The objective is to build predictive models, classify vehicle categories, and discover hidden patterns in the data through clustering, supported by robust evaluation metrics and visualizations.
# 📌 Project Objectives
-- Preprocess and standardize vehicle data
-- Apply regression, classification, and clustering techniques
-- Compare model performance using appropriate metrics
-- Discover natural groupings in vehicle data
-- Visualize results using dimensionality reduction techniques
-- Provide an interactive Streamlit-based interface
# 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
🔹 Supervised Learning
  Multiple Linear Regression – to predict continuous values such as price
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier – for vehicle classification
